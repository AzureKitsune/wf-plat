## wf-plat

wf-plat is a simple app/website that takes a given amount of platinum (in-game premium for a game called Warframe) and converts it to its corresponding real-life amount.

For example: 75 platinum == $5.0

I created this project to help me learn React JS and get better at web development. I'm quite rusty so please bear with me.
